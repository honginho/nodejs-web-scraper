# Simple Web Scraper
Reference from [node-web-scraper](https://github.com/scotch-io/node-web-scraper)
================

Simple web scraper to get `title`, `datetime`, `summary`, and `content` of news from the website **@Simon Huang** gave me.

To run this example use the following commands:

``` shell
$ npm install
$ node server.js
```

It will start up our node server; navigate to `http://localhost:8081/scrape/urls`, `http://localhost:8081/scrape/data` and see what's going on.
